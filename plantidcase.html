        <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
        <p> An API (Application Programming Interface) is a type of software interface that allows for the exchange of data, code, and other components between the users and various software applications, servers, systems. 
            This study section reports on the implementation of a Plant identifier API that is capable of identifying sick plants when a photo of a plant is inserted into the API. This API returns the scientific name, common name, disease probability, type of disease, and other components that
            the API returns. This plant disease identifier API can be used to help people who work in the agricultural sector identify plant diseases in the event of their plants becoming unhealthy. Ideally, plant identifier API can be a viable solution method to prevent the spread of plant diseases and crop failure due to 
            the disease identification component of this API. </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Creation of Plant API HTML page and Postman Account</li>
                <li>Inclusion of JSON and Axios Packages (on Replit)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Understanding of APIs, identifying goals, and overall knowledge</li>
                <li>Creation of Plant ID API account through web.plant.id</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Developing the JavaScript code</li>
                <li>Writing out the Plant Identifier HTML code</li>
                <li>Troubleshooting & Testing</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
        <p><strong>Factors considered:</strong> Some of the factors considered included researching the types of API that would be compatible towards solving the issue at 
                   hand. An understanding of the JavaScript code should also be taken into consideration in order to create the functions that will identify the plant disease.
        </p>

     
        <p><strong>Recommendations/Suggested Actions:</strong> Researching different API machine learning services along with finding the JavaScript codes that will be implemented for the API functions and data retrieval.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Rationale for Recommendations/Suggested Actions:</strong> In order to fulfill the recommendations, conducting research on the Plant ID APIs exploring their features and compatibility along with testing the effectiveness of the API when identifying the plant health issues.  </p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="project-analysis">Project Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Contributing Factors to the Issue:</strong> The main factor contributing to the issue would be the lack of information and knowledge on the common plant diseases. The pace of identifying the plant disease is also another factor to take into consideration. </p>
            <p><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses of the API:</strong> The strength of the API lies in its efficiency of identifying the plant health issue due to its quick access to the plant information database. </p>
            <p><strong>Steps Taken:</strong> The steps that were taken weas gradually easing into the concepts aand frameworks of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), Axios (JavaScript Library), APIs, Postman(platform for API building)
            <p><strong>Concepts learned from API:</strong> Familiarization of several Javascript frameworks & libaries, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and debugging/troubleshooting null errors were some of the concepts that were picked up during the API integration process.  </p>
           
            
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id = "Challenges">Challenges</h2>
            <p> The challenges included many bugs that were present in the Javascript functions and parameters. There were many syntax errors, unexpected datatypes, null properties, and other case sensitivity issues. Some of the functions did not work due to missing semi-colons or backticks.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="Solution">Solution</h2>
            <p> Debugging and troubleshooting errors, and double checking if the HTML code contained the same spelling and case sensitivity as the JavaScript code. Many of the spelling mistakes and case sensivity prevented the API from functioning properly. The API was finally able to function properly when all the spellings were corrected. </p>
        </section>

      
        <section> 
            <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p> In the end, the API was able to succesfully identify the plant and the disease associated with the plant when the image is inserted into the API.
                In the future, I intend to further develop this project by incorporating additional identification features, which will include a design with the intent to enhance the accuracy of plant recognition and expand the categorization of species. </p>
