        <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
        <p> Healthier foods such as fresh produce have always been on the expensive side. As a result of this, this creates a food insecurity issue among the people who cannot access healthier food options due to lack of affordability. In addition to the existing food insecurity, the high cost of living  in New York City makes fresh produce more difficult to access.The objective of this report is to document the process of making a hydroponic kratky system that would make healthier food options more accessible via food pantries and farmers markets.</p>

        <h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong>Growing up in New York City, the cost of living can be very relentless regardless of socio-economic status.. Due to the high cost of living, people have to resort to cheaper food options such as fast food and non-perishable canned foods to get by.  As a result, many of those people will be lacking in the nutrients that vegetables provide. The produce item sections in the supermarkets are often high in cost to the point where people can’t afford them. My main intent is to grow some kale microgreens that can be accessed by people who were not able to afford those healthier food options. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>What is the problem?:</strong>The high cost of fresh produce in New York City, coupled with the lack of affordability for healthier food options, has led to a food insecurity issue. In addition, the high cost of living has made it difficult for people to access fresh produce options.  </p>

        <p><strong>Factors considered:</strong>Ensuring safety is paramount, especially given the involvement of electrical components and water circulation in the NFT system. Furthermore, considering the possibility of occasional errors, it is imperative to establish a maintenance schedule and detailed troubleshooting procedures. Consistent checks for system components, potential blockages, and nutrient solution levels are crucial elements of this proactive approach.</p>

     
        <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong>Recommendations involve a thorough assessment of the designated area, customizing the system based on individual preferences and requirements, and consistently maintaining and monitoring the system for optimal performance.</p>

        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong>The support for the recommendations includes training and education programs to equip individuals with essential knowledge and skills, additional resources, and ongoing support mechanisms for continuous assistance, adaptability, and community engagement.</p>

            <p><strong>Contributing Factors to the Issue:</strong> The main factor contributing to the issue would be the lack of affordable fresh produce.</p>
            <p><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses of the Location:</strong> The strength of the location comes from the system being very replicable as long as the system is in an indoor setting. The weakness of the location stems from the system being indoor dependent.</p>

            <p><strong>Concepts learned from Intro to Agtech:</strong> This program has taught me the utmost resilience. The web programming portion of this course taught me how to continuously troubleshoot problems due to the very "buggy" nature of programming as a whole. Troubleshooting and trial and error were also applied and learned with the agriculture part of the course, finding the right approach to the hydroponic systems and researching the pros and cons of each hydroponic system.</p>

            <p>At first I went with the wick method system. I wasn’t aware of its downsides and I decided that the downsides outweigh the upsides. The main downside lies in its design that ultimately impacts the total crop output, the wick rope may not achieve even nutrient distribution.

            <h2 id="Solution">Solution</h2>
            <p>Despite me being very enthusiastic about starting the wick system, I decided to go in another direction. I ended up choosing the kratky system method due to its low maintenance, cost-effectiveness  and high efficiency. In addition to the kratky system, I decided to add an extra component which air-pump to the Those parameters are ideal for making a hydroponic system for kale microgreen growth.</p>

            <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>To conclude this all , I would improve upon my process by adding an additional component since my kratky system is pretty simplistic and straightforward. If I had some advice for someone reattempting to build my farm system would be to spread the knowledge and awareness for advocating the importance of making healthier food more accessible/affordable. My biggest takeaway from this project is also related to the advice that I would give to someone trying to replicate my farm system. I want to make fresh produce more accessible to everyone and hopefully bring about change to the systemic issue of unaffordable produce. 
            </p>
            <p>In the future, I plan to continue working on this project and expand it to include more plant species and different growing conditions. I also plan to continue to learn about the best practices for hydroponic systems and the importance of ensuring safety and reliability. I am excited to see the results of this project and to continue to contribute to making healthier food options more accessible
