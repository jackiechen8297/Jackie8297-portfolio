        <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
        <p> During our time at the intro to agricultural tech program for Change Food For Good, we took the time to learn basic construction skills over the course of three seperate days. 
            On each day, we were given a different task to carry out. Our construction training was overseen by a construction company LLC 
            called Soulful Synergy where they instructed us on the basics of construction tools with their respective purposes and usages.
            We were able to gain hands-on experience with the tools and the machines that are commonly used in a construction
            worksite.</p>

        <p><strong>Background:</strong> In this agricultural tech program for Change Food For Good, we learned several skills spanning across web development using html, css, 
            and javascript, sustainable hydroponic farm design in the agricultural portion, and the use of power and hand tools in addition to site safety measures for the construction portion of the program.

                    <li><strong>Wire Cutters:</strong> Pliers designed to cut through electrical wire, cable ties, or other small wires.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety Goggles:</strong> Essential protective eyewear designed to shield the eyes from flying debris and dust during construction tasks.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

            <li><strong>Day 3:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Learned how to use table saws to cut down PVC pipes for NFT channels used for hydroponic farming.</li>
                <li>Used power drills to make holes in the PVC pipes for plant placement.</li>
                <li>Applied a heat gun to warp the PVC pipes as needed.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          

        
        <p><strong>What is the problem?:</strong> Construction worksites often present safety hazards, this creates the potential of workers sustaining injuries. </p>
        

        <p><strong>Factors considered:</strong> Lack of safety awareness and lack of personal protective equipment(PPE) can lead to safety hazards. The elimination of safety hazards should always be prioritized.
        </p>

     
        <p><strong>Recommendations/Suggested Actions:</strong> In order to ensure safety among the worksite, conducting safety precautions such as making sure everyone is
           equipped with every PPE that is required can reduce the risk of sustaining injuries. Prompting the workers to be cautious of any sorrounding safety hazards 
           and reminding them to wear all required personal protective equipment at all times will help eliminate the presence of safety hazards.

        <!-- add the image screenshots here  -->
            <p><strong>Concepts learned from Construction:</strong> Core concepts of maintaining a safe worksite environment were learned during the
               entire duration of the construction days. A strong emphasis on keeping on all personal protective equipment such as ear plugs, helmets, safety goggles, gloves, and high-visibility vests are used to mitigate the risk of 
               injury. Proper handling and usage of the tools were also important learning lessons since misuse can threaten/compromise the safety 
               of the workers in the vincinity. Last but not least, team work was also emphasized by the instructors as teamwork
               can increase productivity and improve work efficiency on the worksite.

            <h2 id = "Challenges">Challenges</h2>
            <p> Some of the challenges that may be faced include the initial learning curve of using each tool. Operating the power saw for the first time may also be 
              intimidating for those who have never operated one before. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="Solution">Solution</h2>
            <p> Listening to the step by step instructions provided by the instructors led each of us to properly maintain worksite safety 
              and ensure the correct usage of the tools. This approach by the Soulful Synergy instructors 
             encouraged concise communication, reduced likelihood of injury, and boosted our certainity/confidence 
             in operating the tools.  </p>

        <section> 
            <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p> All in all, these construction training days provided great insight into maintaining a 
              safer worksite environment along with. We were able to develop a strong foundation in tool usage and being able to troubleshoot the challenges we faced together while carrying out the instructions of building out the NFT channels and the other components. The skills we learned during the duration of instruction developed 
              important skills of strong-communication, teamwork, and other skills that can be transferrable to 
              any other industries of work.
