        <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
        <p> During our time at the intro to agricultural tech program for Change Food For Good, we took the time to learn basic construction skills over the course of three seperate days. 
            On each day, we were given a different task to carry out. Our construction training was overseen by a construction company LLC 
            called Soulful Synergy where they instructed us on the basics of construction tools with their respective purposes and usages.    </p>

        <h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> In this agricultural tech program for Change Food For Good, we learned several skills spanning across web development using html, css, 
            and javascript, sustainable hydroponic farm design in the agricultural portion, and the use of power and hand tools in addition to site safety measures for the construction portion of the program.

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          

        
        <p><strong>What is the problem?:</strong>The high cost of fresh produce in New York City, coupled with the lack of affordability for healthier food options, has led to a food insecurity issue. In addition, the high cost of living has made it difficult for people to access fresh produce options.  </p>
        

        <p><strong>Factors considered:</strong> The growing conditions for this system should be taken into account the most. Making sure the water pH and EC levels are within range that allows for optimal growth. The growing Growth medium content is also optional since microgreens aren’t dependent on growing mediums for overall growth. Water must also never make contact with the electricity due to  safety concerns. 
        </p>

     
        <p><strong>Recommendations/Suggested Actions:</strong> For water, it is highly suggested to use filtered water for sanitation purposes and ensure the pH level to be around 5.5-6.5 with the use of the pH meter.  As for safety, make sure that the growing bins are always evenly leveled to make sure the water doesn’t spill and make contact with the electrical components. The potential water leakage can damage the LED lights or cause the entire system to malfunction.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Rationale for Recommendations/Suggested Actions:</strong> In order to fufill the recommendations, prior knowledge of the hydroponic systems and the smaller components of the systems should be taught and introduced before being able to build and sustain a hydroponic system. A basic understanding of water pH/EC is also required in order to maintain the livelihood of the hydroponic system.</p>

            <p><strong>Contributing Factors to the Issue:</strong> The main factor contributing to the issue would be the lack of affordable fresh produce.</p>
            <p><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses of the Location:</strong> The strength of the location comes from the system being very replicable as long as the system is in an indoor setting. The system is also relatively low maintenance and simplistic which means the system doesn't require constant monitoring.The weakness of the location stems from the system being indoor dependent.</p>

            <p><strong>Concepts learned from Intro to Agtech:</strong> This program has taught me the utmost resilience. The web programming portion of this course taught me how to continuously troubleshoot problems due to the very "buggy" nature of programming as a whole. Troubleshooting and trial and error were also applied and learned with the agriculture part of the course, finding the right approach to the hydroponic systems and researching the pros and cons of each hydroponic system.</p>

            <p>At first I went with the wick method system. I wasn’t aware of its downsides and I decided that the downsides outweigh the upsides. The main downside lies in its design that ultimately impacts the total crop output, the wick rope may not achieve even nutrient distribution. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="Solution">Solution</h2>
            <p>Despite me being very enthusiastic about starting the wick system, I decided to go in another direction. I ended up choosing the kratky system method due to its low maintenance, cost-effectiveness  and high efficiency. In addition to the kratky system, I decided to add an extra component which air-pump to the Those parameters are ideal for making a hydroponic system for kale microgreen growth.</p>

            <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>To conclude this all , I would improve upon my process by adding an additional component since my kratky system is pretty simplistic and straightforward. If I had some advice for someone reattempting to build my farm system would be to spread the knowledge and awareness for advocating the importance of making healthier food more accessible/affordable. My biggest takeaway from this project is also related to the advice that I would give to someone trying to replicate my farm system. I want to make fresh produce more accessible to everyone and hopefully bring about change to the systemic issue of unaffordable produce. 
            </p>
            <p>In the future, I plan to continue working on this project and expand it to include more plant species and different growing conditions. I also plan to continue to learn about the best practices for hydroponic systems and the importance of ensuring safety and reliability. I am excited to see the results of this project and to continue to contribute to making healthier food options more accessible
